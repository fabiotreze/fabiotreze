# 👋 Hello!

Welcome to my GitHub space!

This is a **personal repository**, dedicated to independent studies, experiments, and technical projects.  
While many of my projects involve cloud architecture and automation, **no material here contains confidential, sensitive, or proprietary information**.

My main focus areas are **Azure Infrastructure**, **modern cloud solutions**, and **the occasional crypto experiment**.
